# Admin Guide

- ## First Steps

  Before you can generate and save settings, you will need to install the Scriptify codes and create an Administrator config page.

  Depending on the modules you are using, and what you would like your members to access, you may need to create a User config page as well. These steps are all outlined in the [Installation](./installing.md) guide.

- ## Configuring Modules

  - YouTube guide for this step

  When you first load your Admin config page, you will be taken to the "Enable/Disable Plugins" tab. Here, you can quickly toggle plugins on and off as you need. Disabling a plugin does not destroy the data related to it, so you can turn it back on whenever you need to.

  Each plugin will be listed with the enable/disable button to the right. Click the button to enable or disable the plugin as you require.

  Plugins that are in a disabled state will have a button to "Enable"
