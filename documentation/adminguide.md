# Admin Guide

- ## First Steps

  Before you can generate and save settings, you will need to install the Scriptify codes and create an Administrator config page.

  Depending on the modules you are using, and what you would like your members to access, you may need to create a User config page as well. These steps are all outlined in the [Installation](./installing.md) guide.

- ## Configuring Modules

  - YouTube guide for this step

  When you first load your Admin config page, you will be taken to the "Enable/Disable Plugins" tab. Here, you can quickly toggle plugins on and off as you need. Disabling a plugin does not destroy the data related to it, so you can turn it back on whenever you need to.

  Each plugin will be listed with the enable/disable button to the right. Click the button to enable or disable the plugin as you require.

  Plugins that are in a disabled state will have a button to "Enable"

  When a plugin is Enabled, it's related settings will also be available in the left-hand sidebar.

- ## Generating settings

  Each plugin will come with its own settings to customise. Please see the relevant admin guide for each plugin to learn about specific plugin settings. You can find direct links to the admin guides of each plugin on the [Module List](./moduleList.md) page.

  - ### Getting your configuration code

    Once you have enabled and configured your plugins, you can generate the settings code.

    To do this, click the "Generate Code" button in the left-hand sidebar.

    To get a copy of your configuration code with all of the changes you have made to it, click "Generate Code". This will fill the textbox below with your updated code.

  - ### Retrieving a configuration code & autosaving

    Generating the code does **not** save your changes.

    There is a small auto-save feature that may save the day if your browser crashes unexpectedly, but it is not something to rely on. You can retrieve the last auto-saved version of your configuration code (if one exists) by clicking the "Get Settings From Last Session" button.

    The auto-save feature is triggered every time the tab is changed in the admin configuration page. While this may be useful, it is not reliable. The only reliable method of saving your settings is to follow the saving procedure below.
