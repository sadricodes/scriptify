## Introduction

Scriptify by SadriCodes is a user-friendly JavaScript plugin system for administrators of Jcink forum websites.

**Not a confident coder? No problem!**

Enable and configure Scriptify modules as easily as clicking a few buttons and saving the code in your Admin Control Panel! Designed for non-coders, dedicated to providing helpful documentation.

**Free to use, free to build on**

Scriptify will never be hidden behind a paywall. All features will _always_ be available for public use. We believe that free resources for Jcink users enrich our community, and that's why we're allowing _anyone_ to build on this code! So long as the end products are always free, like Scriptify itself!

## Latest News

- December 18th, 2022: Installation documentation is now available for review. We would love to get your feedback on whether you find the current documentation easy to follow! Required scripts are not yet publicly hosted and Scriptify is not yet ready to be released.

- ### Post Wrapper Switch

  **Post Wrapper Switch** makes it possible for admins to set a variety of custom fields to be filled in at post time - swap out avatars, usernames and more! Allow users to create saved characters they can access via a dropdown, and make a list of NPC characters that users can select to post with. Don't want everyone to have access to an NPC, or the Wrapper Switch system? Include and exclude members or groups with a flexible permissions system applied per NPC!

## Usage

This project is provided free of charge to all Jcink users. Users are free to fork and develop their own versions of Scriptify. Users may create modified versions of Scriptify for their own use, or to release as _free resources_ for the wider Jcink community.

Projects derived from Scriptify, using all or any part of its original code, may _not_ be sold. Developers releasing their own modified versions may include options for users to pay if they choose, but the _fully featured_ version of the project _must be available without cost_.

Skins may be sold that include Scriptify as part of the skin's functionality, so long as appropriate documentation is supplied to end users for installing and configuring Scriptify properly. If a customised version of Scriptify has been made for a skin that is for sale, the modified Scriptify code must also be available to download _without_ purchase of the skin.

Scriptify is developed entirely by Sadrienne during hobby time. While all efforts will be made to resolve support issues, she is but one person who can only do so much.
